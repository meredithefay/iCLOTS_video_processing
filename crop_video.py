This script corresponds to tools available in version 1.0b1, more recent implementations of tools
may be available within the iCLOTS software and in source code at github.com/iCLOTS

Script function that crops videos (.avi) within a selected directory
--No other changes are made to videos

Input variables
--start_frame: first frame you would like to retain
--end_frame: last frame you would like to retain

Output files
--All videos with frames cropped to same range
--Provided within a "Cropped" folder within the original directory

Some tips from the iCLOTS team:
--This script is most useful for:
----Removing portions of the video clearly affected by changes in microscopy acquisition settings
------e.g., changes in laser power or illumination intensity
----Shortening videos to reduce computational analysis time
--Providing a start and end frame value (n) is most precise
----Values must be integers
--To start and end at roughly a given time, multiply that time (in seconds) by the FPS imaging rate
----FPS = frames per second, a microscope acquisition setting
--If end_frame is greater than n frames in the video, it will stop writing at the end of the video
----The strings labeling the directory and frame will be the original value you provided
